# JS and CSS Clock | Better JavaScript30

[This project](https://ivanajeo.github.io/better-javascript30/02_JsAndCssClock/) was initially based on [WesBos JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/), but have been recreated and made better by me.

In this project, I added logic to the hour hand to make its movement more precise, allowing it to move every minute and second.

I also removed the transition when the hands of the clock reach 12 o'clock, preventing them from jumping to 9 o'clock (as 9 o'clock is at 0 degrees). This ensures a smoother movement of the hands.

Additionally, I added clock markers to make it easier for users to read the time.

Finally, I used translateY to position the clock hands and markers perfectly centered in the middle.

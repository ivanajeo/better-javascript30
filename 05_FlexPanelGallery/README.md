# Flex Panels | Better JavaScript30

[This project](https://ivanajeo.github.io/better-javascript30/05_FlexPanelGallery/) was initially based on [WesBos JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/), but have been recreated and made better by me.

In this project, the initial background is set to greyscale. When user clicks on a panel, the colors come back.

# Interactive Canvas | Better JavaScript30

[This project](https://ivanajeo.github.io/better-javascript30/08_InteractiveCanvas/) was initially based on [WesBos JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/), but has been recreated and made better by me.

In this project, I added a `settings panel` that allows users to choose the brush color. There are two options: black and rainbow. I also added a slider to enable users to adjust the brush size.

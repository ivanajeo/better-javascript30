# JS Address Book | Better JavaScript30

[This project](https://ivanajeo.github.io/better-javascript30/06_TypeAhead/) was initially based on [WesBos JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/), but has been recreated and made better by me.

In this project, instead of using two event listeners, `change` and `keyup`, I use just one `input` event listener, as it already works perfectly for handling the task.

Additionally, I changed the search box input type from `text` to `search` to make it more semantically correct.
